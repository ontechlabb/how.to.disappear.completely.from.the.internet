Every action you take online leaves a trace, and the digital footprints you create can be observed by various people, organizations, etc. But disappearing from the internet isn’t as simple as closing your account—it takes a little effort.

**Here’s how to do it.**

## Delete Your Social Network Accounts
There are a number of reasons why you might want to delete your social media accounts. If you’re concerned about your privacy and want to vanish from the internet, deleting your social media accounts is a must. Although this may seem like an obvious step, it’s actually not as easy as it sounds. But don’t worry, we will explain how to delete yourself from every social platform on the internet.

## Deactivate Instagram and Facebook Accounts
Here are the steps you need to follow to delete your Facebook and Instagram accounts:

### Facebook
* You can either deactivate your Facebook account for a set amount of time or permanently delete it. To do so, log in and go to Settings > Your Facebook Information > Deactivation and Deletion, and choose the option you prefer. You can deactivate your account at any time, but this action only hides it, so that your account is still there and you may resume using it at any moment. However, if you delete it, then all of your data will be erased, and you wouldn’t be able to reactivate it (after 30 days).

* After you delete yourself from the internet, it’s possible that some messages will still appear even though your name will be removed from any post or photo you’ve been tagged in. However, the photos themselves will remain even after your name has been removed, and if you want to remove them completely, ask the person who posted them to delete them.

### Instagram


Deleting your Instagram account is a bit simpler. You should only be aware that you can’t delete it from your iOS/ Android app; you should do it from your browser.

* Go to the “Delete Your Account” page from a mobile or PC browser. If you’re not already logged into Instagram on the web, you’ll be required to do so. Before you delete yourself from Instagram, make sure you know your Instagram password, as you’ll probably need to enter it a couple of times during the process.
* Next, select one of the dropdown options next to “Why are you deleting your account?” and re-enter your password. Only after you’ve chosen a reason from the menu will the option to permanently remove your account appear.
* Click Delete [your username] once it appears.
* Keep in mind that you won’t be able to restore your account 30 days after you ask Instagram to delete it. You’ll have to create a new one if you change your mind.

### Deactivate LinkedIn Account
The next step of how to remove your name from the internet is deactivating your LinkedIn account. Closing your account means that your profile and access to all of your LinkedIn information will be deleted permanently. To deactivate your LinkedIn account:

* Log in to LinkedIn and go to your profile page.
* Click on the Me icon in the top bar, then select View profile from the dropdown menu.
* Scroll down to the bottom of your profile page and click on Manage my account.
* On the next page, click Deactivate or close my account under Account preferences.
* Enter your password when prompted, then click Continue.

As the last step, you will be given a series of options as to why you are leaving LinkedIn; usually, people select ‘I don’t find LinkedIn valuable’ or ‘I don’t use LinkedIn enough’.
